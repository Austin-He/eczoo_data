name: 'Analog cluster-state code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.73.032318,arxiv:quant-ph/0605198,arxiv:0903.3233}'

alternative_names:

  - 'Bosonic cluster-state code'

description: |
  A code based on a continuous-variable (CV), or analog, cluster state.
  Such a state can be used to perform MBQC of logical modes, which substitutes the temporal dimension necessary for decoding a conventional code with a spatial dimension.
  The exact analog cluster state is non-normalizable, so approximate constructions have to be considered.

  Analog cluster states are analog stabilizer states defined on a graph.
  There is one nullifier \(\hat{\eta}_j\) per graph vertex \(j\) of the form
  \begin{align}
    \hat{\eta}_j = \hat{p}_{j} - \sum_{k\in N(j)} V_{jk} \hat{x}_k~,
  \end{align}
  where the neighborhood \(N(j)\) is the set of vertices which share an edge with \(j\), and where \(V_{jk}\) is a weighted (real-valued) adjacency matrix of a graph \cite{arxiv:1912.06463}.

  Analog cluster states, like cluster states, can be defined on various geometries.
  Analog cluster states defined on a 1D array of modes are called quantum wires \cite{arxiv:0804.4468,arxiv:0811.2799}, not to be confused with the Kitaev quantum wire, a fermion code.
  Analog cluster states defined on a 1D ladder are sometimes called dual-rail, not to be confused with the dual-rail code.

protection: |
  Protection is related to the analog stabilizer code underlying the analog cluster state.

      detail: 'Analog cluster-state codes are particular analog stabilizer codes. Any analog stabilizer state is equivalent to an analog cluster state under a single-mode Gaussian circuit \cite{arxiv:2503.15698}. Relaxing the real weighted adjacency matrix of an analog cluster state to be complex yields a description of a general analog (i.e., Gaussian) stabilizer state \cite{arxiv:1007.0725}. Pure Gaussian states, which are normalizable approximate versions of analog stabilizer states, are not equivalent to finitely squeezed analog cluster states via Gaussian local unitaries \cite{arxiv:1912.06463}.'
